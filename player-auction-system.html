    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>The Player Auction System is designed for competitive gaming environments where players can be auctioned off to teams in real-time. This system enables participants to place bids on available players, track the current bid status, and manage player ownership through an intuitive interface. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, providing a reliable and scalable system for managing bids and player data. The frontend, developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensures that users can easily interact with the system, view the player details, and place bids seamlessly. This project integrates real-time bidding updates, making it suitable for fast-paced auctions in esports or similar competitive platforms.</p>
